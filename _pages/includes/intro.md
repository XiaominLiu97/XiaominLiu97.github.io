I'm a Ph.D candidate for Electrical Science and Technology at the Department of Electronic enginnering (电子系), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, and under the supervision of Professor [Qunbi Zhuge](https://zhuge.sjtu.edu.cn/). 

My current research interests focus on **Optical communication networking** . 
- **Optical network**
  - Multi-band modeling for QoT
    - Preprocessing: *feature learning network* (OFC)
    
  - Nonlinearity
- **Monitoring**
  - Efficient Sequence Generator and MAC Implementation (NANOARCH'22, TNANO'24)
- **Optimization**
  - 8x8 High-thoughput Soft-output MIMO detector (TVLSI'21)

My research interest includes speech synthesis, neural machine translation and automatic music generation. I have published 50+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jhntj54AAAAJ&hl'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FXiaominLiu97%2FXiaominLiu97.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD.
