I'm a Ph.D candidate for Information engineering at the Department of Electronic engineering (电子系), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, and under the supervision of Professor [Qunbi Zhuge](https://zhuge.sjtu.edu.cn/). 

My research focus on the modeling, monitoring, and optimization for the long-haul WDM optical networks (especially the Backbone networks), aim at building self-driving optical networks with the assistance of data-driven machine learning techniques. I am also working on the control and optimization for the multi-band optical system
- **Physical layer modeling**
  - QoT estimation for multi-band system
  - Fiber nonlinearity
  - Optical amplifiers (EDFA & Raman amplifier)
- **Physical layer monitoring**
  - Fiber nonlinearity, Soft failures, Filtering effect, etc.
- **Nertwork Optimization**
  - Power optimization in C and C&L band for Capacity optimization
