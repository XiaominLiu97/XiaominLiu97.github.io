I'm a Ph.D candidate for Information engineering at the Department of Electronic engineering (电子系), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai, China, and under the supervision of Professor [Qunbi Zhuge](https://zhuge.sjtu.edu.cn/). I graduated from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) with a bachelor’s degree of Information Enginerring (AI Special Class) from the Department of Electronic engineering (电子系).

My research focus on the modeling, monitoring, and optimization for the long-haul WDM optical networks (especially the Backbone networks), aim at building self-driving optical networks with the assistance of data-driven machine learning techniques. I am also working on the control and optimization for the multi-band optical system. As the first author, I have published 7 journal papers and 7 conference papers.<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jhntj54AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>
